AlienInvade
===========
This game is a functional interpretation of the game Space Invaders, that is designed and produced through the process of reverse engineering.

Changed design elements,added new characters objects,functions and sounds to the game such as the boss alien which is worth 20 points when killed, the green alien missile and the scoreboard. Made changes within functions such as cahnging the framerate, game speed,and the frequency of alien missiles fired. Other changes can be seen in the code files as I have put comments above almost every piece of code. This was a tough but very useful project since it showed me what javascript and canvas can be used for.
